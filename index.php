        My name is Isaac Jimenez. I am currently enjoying the programming side
        of web development. Growing up, the world wide web was always a
        magical place. It was a free resource to learn anything you ever
        wanted and visit any place around the world with a few keystrokes.
        Being able to learn the mechanisms that occur behind the scenes of a
        website has enchanted my curiosity. From brainstorming ideas for
        websites (or tools) to reviewing how to improve the final product, I
        have not found anything as rewarding as learning web development.
    </p>

        Personal hobbies that I enjoy are reading, playing video games and
        learning about mechanisms of the brain to optimize my own personal
        growth.
